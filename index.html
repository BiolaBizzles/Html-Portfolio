			<h4>Here's a time line of Dr Borlaug's life:</h4>
			
			<div class="list-content">
				<ul>
					<li> <strong>1914</strong>- Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
					<li> <strong>1933</strong>- Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks to a <br> Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
					<li> <strong>1935</strong>- Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he <br> said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
					<li> <strong>1937</strong>- Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service </li>
					<li> <strong>1938</strong>- Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. <br> Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who <br> teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
					<li> <strong>1941</strong>- Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. <br> Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control<br> malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
					<li> <strong>1942</strong>- Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
					<li> <strong>1944</strong>- Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife,<br> and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years,<br> his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different<br> varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
					<li> <strong>1945</strong>- Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
					<li> <strong>1953</strong>- crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American <br> breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of<br> Mexico's wheat.</li>
					<li> <strong>1962</strong>- Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br>subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding <br>population</li>
					<li> <strong>1970</strong>- receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
					<li> <strong>1983</strong>- helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum <br>yields</li>
					<li> <strong>1984</strong>- becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
					<li> <strong>2005</strong>- states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that <br>genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out <br>of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've<br> been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called <br>it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li>
					<li> <strong>2009</strong>- dies at the age of 95.</li>
					<br>
				</ul>
